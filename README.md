# Mapping-Earthquakes with APIs and JSON #

## Project Overview: 

Based on what we learnt in the model, in this project, we will create different layers beside earthquake map. This time, using Tectonic Geo Json sata, we will implement the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth. Moreover, we will report all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, with additional layer on the earthquake map.  

## Resources:
- Earthquakes GeoJSON, Techtonic Plate GeoJSON
- HTML/CSS, JavaScript Studio Code, Leaflet.js
